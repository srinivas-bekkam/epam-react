### Paradigm
Paradigm can also be termed as method to solve some problem or do some task. Programming paradigm is an approach to solve problem using some programming language or also we can say it is a method to solve a problem using tools and techniques that are available to us following some approach. 

#### Imperative programming paradigm: 
It is one of the oldest programming paradigm. It features close relation to machine architecture. It is based on Von Neumann architecture. It works by changing the program state through assignment statements. It performs step by step task by changing state. The main focus is on how to achieve the goal. The paradigm consist of several statements and after execution of all the result is stored.

**Advantages:** 

- Very simple to implement
- It contains loops, variables etc.

 **Disadvantage:**

- Complex problem cannot be solved
- Less efficient and less productive
- Parallel programming is not possible

**Examples of Imperative programming paradigm:**

- C : developed by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson
- Fortran : developed by John Backus for IBM
- Basic : developed by John G Kemeny and Thomas E Kurtz 



Imperative programming is divided into three broad categories: 
- Procedural, 
- OOP 
- parallel processing. 

These paradigms are as follows:

**Procedural**

This paradigm emphasizes on procedure in terms of under lying machine model. There is no difference in between procedural and imperative approach. It has the ability to reuse the code and it was boon at that time when it was in use because of its reusability.

Examples : C, C++, Java, Pascal

**Object oriented programming**

Object oriented programming â€“ 
The program is written as a collection of classes and object which are meant for communication.

Example: C++, Java, Python.

**Parallel processing approach** 

Parallel processing is the processing of program instructions by dividing them among multiple processors.

Example: C++, Java, Python.

### Declarative programming paradigm: 

It is divided as Logic, Functional, Database. In computer science the declarative programming is a style of building programs that expresses logic of computation without talking about its control flow.

Declarative Programming cane be furthur categorize as Logical, Functional, and Database.

**Logic programming paradigms**
It can be termed as abstract model of computation. It would solve logical problems like puzzles, series etc. In logic programming we have a knowledge base which we know before and along with the question and knowledge base which is given to machine, it produces result. 

Example: Prolog.

**Functional programming**

The central model for the abstraction is the function which are meant for some specific computation. Data are loosely coupled to functions.The function hide their implementation. Function can be replaced with their values without changing the meaning of the program. Some of the languages like perl, javascript mostly uses this paradigm.

Example: JavaScript, Haskell, Scala, Lisp

**Database/Data driven**

This programming methodology is based on data and its movement. Program statements are defined by data rather than hard-coding a series of steps.

Example: SQL
