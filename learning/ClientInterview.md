Interview Questions:
-------------------
Client: S&P 
Project: Scorecard Team
**Interviewer**: Maulesh Mevade
 
Q1. Short introduction and previous projects
Q2. React Router
Q3. How to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the content of the application?? Explain private routing with code implementation.
Q4. Error Boundary - Its uses and how to build an error boundary component ?? The lifecycles methods used to build the error boundary component.
Q5. There are 3 components Parent1, child1 and child2. If an error occurs in child2 then an error message should be  shown for child2 component only and rest of the component should render as it is without any error message. Similarly for child1,The error message will be completely different  from child2. We need to write the code for this using ErrorBoundry Component??
Q6. useEffect and its uses.
Q7. Some programs to check the useEffect concepts like how to make API calls on page load.
Q8. Can we make API call outside useEffect?? What happens if we do so?
Q9. Write a JS program to sum up the digits of the numbers. For example:- 2576 -> 2 + 5 + 7 + 6 -> 20 -> 2 + 0 -> 2 (**Interviewer** was expecting a one liner solution for this).
Q10.Write a program to remove everything except even numbers from the array but you can not use a new array.
    Ex: I/p:- [1,2,3,a,d,f,"#",4,6,4,4,")","("] => [2,4,6,4,4]( **Interviewer** was expecting a one liner solution for this)
Q11.How react works behind the scene?? How it renders the UI?? Reconciliation, Virtual DOM and diffing algorithm?? 
Q12.Context API and scenario based question. Create two component - Parent and child. Parent has a state num and child has a set of buttons to increment and decrement the num. You need to make it working without using props. **Interviewer** wanted me to write down all the react components for this.   
Q13.Tell me all the topics you know in React and what all you don't know/Learning as of now.
 
Note: We need to write the programs in Notepad only and any syntax highlighting editor is not allowed.

what is Largest contentful paint and how to optimize it? => this question is excellent , It comes under Network and Asset optimisation, which is very important to understand as frontend developer
there are many techniques and service providers.. 
 
To keep it simple, the question is asking the fastest way to load contents such as images, styles etc.
 
popular ways
1. cdn
2. Various image sizes (compression, resolution)
3. rendering optimal image resolution
etc
 
for SPAs this is super important.
 
there are many good tech blogs and white papers explaining about LCP.
Flipkart, Amazon, Nykaa, many more.

### Hi Neeraj Joshi , there was only one question i.e on System Design which I have answered to best of my knowledge,  interviewer was drilling deep on architecture side end to end design, clean architecture , DevSecops, Domain Design , Context Boundaries, I was stuck at a point related to domain design .

Step 1: Write the functional requirements.
Step 2: Write the non-functional requirements.
Step 3: Write about the different entities involved and the tech stack.
Step 4: Write about the data modelling and data APIs.
Step 5: Draw the high-level architecture.

After discussing on my resume, the next question was on system design " You have 3 departments and a container app how will you design 3 departments have same workflow but different data points and bases on the user login users should be redirected to respective apps, and  architecture,communication, Security

Ramesh Allu
29/04/24 10:31
This is a relevant toipc for FE, it is about MFE with DDD.
Edit: I assume workflow here is a user journey, as it is the same user journey with diff data points, looks like not much about MFE, but a single FE app driven by data at runtime. Like any other function with params.



Ajay Nallanagula1

Ramesh Allu
This seems relevant toipc for FE Lead, it is about MFE with DDD.
Yes from choosing MFE as architecture its front end related. Implementation of context boundaries, deep dive psuedo code of IOC container is where i tumbled. I answered all the patterns like IOC , based on scalability, authentication and authorisation, configs and others 
 

Designing a system that caters to three distinct departments with a unified workflow but different data points requires a thoughtful approach to architecture, communication, and security. This design is particularly relevant for applications that serve multiple user roles or departments, each with its unique data and functionality needs. few  provided examples of applications that fit this model.

- Food Delivery Platform like zomato:
    - Customer App: For customers to browse menus, place orders, and make payments.
    - Restaurant App: For restaurants to manage orders, update menus, and handle billing.
    - Delivery Agent App: For delivery personnel to receive order notifications, navigate to destinations, and update delivery status.
- Hotel Management System like AirBnb:
    - Customer App: Allows guests to book rooms, check-in online, and request services.
    - Hotel Admin App: For hotel administrators to manage bookings, room availability, and pricing.
    - Hotel Agent App: For front desk agents to handle check-ins/check-outs, guest inquiries, and service requests.
- Healthcare Management System like 1MG:
    - Patient App: For patients to book appointments, access medical records, and communicate with healthcare providers.
    - Healthcare Provider App: For doctors and nurses to manage appointments, access patient records, and provide care.
    - Administration App: For healthcare administrators to oversee operations, manage billing, and ensure compliance.
- Educational Platform like ByJus:
    - Student App: For students to access course materials, submit assignments, and receive grades.
    - Instructor App: For teachers to create content, grade assignments, and communicate with students.
    - Administrative App: For school administrators to manage course offerings, enrollments, and faculty assignments.



Ramesh Allu

Edited

A trick here is, many times, it is in the candidates hand to set scope and drive the discussion of an open-ended question in terms of relevancy to the domain and role for which candidate is being interviewed for. For example, how big of a system or take a user journey for the sake simplicity which is more practical to the job role, for which discussion is happening for.
 
Vs
A system design round similar to in MAANG companies, which is ideal but not the most practical for our situation and precisely relevant for this second round in S&P.


Tharakesh Pulikonda
02/05/24 13:01
design a eShop such that as an administrator I am interested to see/manage 
observability
configuration management to scale up or scale down app clusters
MAU and their analytics
Catalogue management
 
How to fallback mechanism if the master db is down ?
How do you design the system such I can life and shift to any cloud vendor ?
What is BFF and PWA ?
In the DDD, how do you set/define the boundary context ?
 
Suppose, if one of your team member is facing an issue which requires your help. Unfortunately you dont have hands on the tools, programming language, understanding of build/compile process etc how do you go about it to solve it ?

- How does the this keyword behave in different contexts in JavaScript, especially in regular functions compared to arrow functions?
- What are the key differences between arrow functions and traditional function expressions in JavaScript regarding syntax and behavior?
- Can you explain prototype inheritance in JavaScript? Please provide an example that demonstrates how inheritance is implemented using prototypes.
- How do async functions work in conjunction with promises in JavaScript? Can you provide an example to illustrate their interaction?
- What best practices should be followed when integrating and utilizing third-party components, such as AG Grid, in a React application? What key considerations should be taken into account?
- What are the main differences between Redux and Redux Toolkit? What advantages does Redux Toolkit provide over traditional Redux?


Output-Based Questions
 
1.Given the following code snippet, can you explain how it demonstrates prototype inheritance?


JavaScript
```
    function Animal() {}
    Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
    console.log('sound!');
    };
    function Dog() {}
    Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
    Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
    Dog.prototype.speak = function() {
    console.log('bark!');
    };
    var pet = new Dog();
    pet.speak();
```
 
2. Analyse the following code. What will be logged to the console, and why?
JavaScript
```
    function Person() {
    this.age = 25;
    setTimeout(function growUp() {
        this.age++;
        console.log(this.age);
    }, 1000);
    }

    var p = new Person();
 ```
 
3. Review the following async function. What will be the output, and in what order will it appear in the console?
 
JavaScript

    async function asyncFunction() {
        console.log('1');
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
        console.log('2');
    }
    console.log('3');
    asyncFunction();
    console.log('4');
```
